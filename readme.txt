Wildly 🌿
Your Personal Wild Food Foraging Companion

Wildly is a lightweight, mobile-first Web App designed for foragers who want to discover, identify, and track wild edibles (mushrooms, berries, and plants) in nature. The app focuses on privacy and utility, allowing users to save their "secret spots" locally without compromising their data.

✨ Features
Smart Identification: Browse a curated database of wild edibles with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.

Secret Spots (GPS): Save your findings with precise GPS coordinates. Locations are stored locally on your device to keep your "gold mines" private.

Multilingual Support: Fully localized UI (Danish, English, etc.) with automatic language detection.

Interactive Maps: Built-in Leaflet.js integration to visualize your finds and get directions via Google Maps.

Foraging Calendar: Detailed seasonality data for every species to know exactly when to go hunting.

Lookalike Protection: Integrated Google Lens/Images shortcuts to help verify species and avoid dangerous lookalikes.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), and Vanilla JavaScript.

Mapping: Leaflet.js for interactive maps.

Storage: LocalStorage for persistent user data without a backend.

UI/UX: Designed with a "Mobile-App" feel using Modern CSS transitions and haptic feedback simulations.

Install as PWA (Optional):
Open the site on your smartphone and "Add to Home Screen" to use it like a native app.

🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
The app uses a custom-built translation engine. To add a new language:

Add the language code to appConfig.languages.

Provide the translations in the translations.json structure.

The app will automatically detect the user's browser language.

🛡️ Privacy
Wildly is built with privacy in mind. All your "Secret Spots" are stored directly in your browser's LocalStorage. If you clear your browser cache, remember to export your data!
